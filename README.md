# Shopify Sales – Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Shopify sales performance with dynamic measure switching, trend titles, and customer insights.

## Highlights
- **Dynamic measures** (Net Sales, Total Quantity, Repeat/Total Customers) with slicer-driven `SWITCH()` logic.
- **Dynamic titles** using `SELECTEDVALUE()` (e.g., “Net Sales Trend Over Time”).
- Data modeling with relationships and DAX (e.g., `RELATED`, `CONCATENATEX`, `SELECTEDVALUE`, `SWITCH`).
- Clean visual layout for trends, KPIs, and city/province breakdowns.# shopify-sales-bi
